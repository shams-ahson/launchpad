Welcome to the Final Station for the 2025 Engineering Week Scavenger Race!

You need to think like a Software Engineer & Cybersecurity Hacker for this challenge...
All I can tell you is that there is a Space Terminal Application. terminal.log will tell you more!
If you're using your own computer, clone the repo. Inspect the repo...our developers may not have the best practices when developing the Space Terminal.
